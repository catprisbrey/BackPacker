# BackPacker

A channel packing application for 3D material image files

BackPacker is a simple efficiency tool designed to simplify the workflow of game developers and 3D artists. This channel packing application streamlines the process of managing image map files, making it easy than to consolidate image files used for materials for game development and 3D projects.

With BackPacker, you can import various 3D image map files, such as albedo, roughness, metallic, and normal maps, and combine them into a single file acourding to your own requirements. You have the flexibility to assign specific red, green, blue, and alpha channels from these files to generate the consolidated output image. This optimized image file contains all the combined data, allowing you to efficiently describe materials within your projects with far fewer files.

By condensing multiple channels into one output image, BackPacker helps you keep your projects slim and efficient. The output file can also be sized according to your project's requirements.

_Built in the Godot Game engine, and some icons may still reflect that_
